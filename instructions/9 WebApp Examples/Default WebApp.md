# Default WebApp



When installing a Reality2 Node, it comes with a default WebApp.  You can completely replace this, of course.  

We regularly add features to this WebApp, so check back here often.  It is intended to be an example of what is possible and contains some helpful functionality.

The WebApp is designed to look a bit like a regular web browser, and if you press the F11 key (or fn-F11 on some computers), it will go full screen and give the illusion of being a browser.

At the top left; the back, forward and reload buttons work as you might expect, going between Grid view and an individual Sentant and back again, for example.

The centre text box contains the Sentant Path.  This is a line-separated path from the current node to the sentant of interest.  Presently, this would only be the Node IP address and the Sentant Name, for example: `localhost|Auckland Museum`  . You can link to another Node easily enough as well, for example: `192.168.1.10|A Sentant`

On the right side is a menu with three modes: Grid, Map and Constructor.  Others may be added later.  There is also the facility to load some key/value pair variables, which are then applied to a loaded Sentant or Swarm.  This can be an easy way to load and test your definitions if you are not keen on Python.

The Map view can be used to show Sentants with the Geospatial plugin activated.  Presently, this only has basic functionality.

The Constructor view allows you to use the Blockly system to construct Swarms and Sentants in a non-textual manner.  ***This is not fully functioning as yet*** .
