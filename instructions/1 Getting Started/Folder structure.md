# Folder structure

The main Reality2 folder contains several subfolders with code and examples.  These are:

- **apps**
  The main Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  Here, you can find the inbuilt plugins such as the Pathing Name System and Authentication, which are mostly stubs for later work.

- **config**
  More stuff related to the Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  Don't change things in here unless you know what you are doing.

- **deps**
  The dependencies for the Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  These are built when you run `mix deps.get`

- **docs**
  Automatically generated files documenting the Elixir code, and these files you are now reading.

- **logos**
  Some possible logos.  Any graphic designers out there want to suggest something better, let me know.

- **web**
  Link into the web pages for Sentants.

- **scripts**
  Various scripts for running the Reality2 node and making runtime versions.  Switch to this directory before running as some files are created relative to this folder.
